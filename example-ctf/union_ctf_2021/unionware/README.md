# unionware (Union CTF 2021)

This challenge is to reverse files at three stages.
We focus on last stage, since crypto functions include in the stage's binary.

| item                 | value |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| file type            | Win32 EXE (PE32)|
| arch                 | i386 (32bit)|
| language             | C++|
| compiler             | Microsoft Visual C++|
| crypto library       | Crypto++(statically linked), proprietary |
| crypto functionality | RSA OAEP with SHA-1(Crypto++), RC4(proprietary)|

## Detect RC4
yara rule `rc4_ksa_x64_2` from rc4/rc4_x64.yar detects RC4 functionality.
Indeed, the function at 0x405e50 includes the instruction: "81 7d f8 00 01 00 00" at 0x405e7b.

## Detect Other Functionality
AES, DES, SHA-1, SHA-2 are detected by yara rules.
This indicates that some crypto library may be linked.
